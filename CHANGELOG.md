## [0.1.1] - 2026-02-17

First stabilization patch after the foundation release.

Focused on improving the stateful DOM addon, update scheduling behavior, and internal safety without introducing breaking API changes.

### Added

- Setter-level memoization to prevent unnecessary DOM mutations when computed values have not changed.
- Microtask-based batched flushing for stateful bindings, aligning DOM updates with modern reactive scheduling patterns.

### Improved

- Safer setter wrapping to avoid prototype reassignment errors.
- More predictable binding execution through snapshot-safe flushing.
- Internal guards to prevent double wrapping of DOM setters.
- Documentation clarity for the DOM module and stateful architecture.

### Fixed

- Resolved read-only prototype mutation error when enhancing setters.
- Eliminated redundant DOM writes caused by unchanged state values.

### Stability Notes

This release strengthens the internal mutation pipeline and prepares the engine for more advanced reactive features while keeping the runtime extremely small and deterministic.

No breaking changes were introduced.
